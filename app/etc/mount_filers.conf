# mount_filers.conf
# Default locations in :
#   /etc/mount_filers.conf : System wide config file
#   /home/bancal/.mount_filers.conf : Personal config file
# 
# Config file for mount_filers
# 
# 5 categories of sections are expected :
#   [global]
#   [config]
#   [require]
#   [substitution]
#   [mount]
# 
# [global]
#   This section describes settings that will be used for all mount
#   sections.
#   It must be unique.
#   
#   Fields :
#       method : which method to use (smb, gvfs_smb, mount.cifs, mount_smbfs, ...)
#       username   : for authtication while mounting
#       domain     : for authtication while mounting
#       auth_realm : not the password, but the realm associated to it.
#                    If several mounts use the same auth_realm, then the
#                    password is only asked once.
#       mount.cifs_filemode : option given to mount.cifs
#       mount.cifs_dirmode  : option given to mount.cifs
#       mount.cifs_options  : option given to mount.cifs
#       gvfs_symlink : specific to methods gvfs_*. Enables the creation
#                      of a symbolic link to "local_path" after mount.
#                      default : True
#       open     : Whether or not to open the folder after mount
#       open_cmd : what to use to open it (set to default will use the OS dependent tool)
# 
# [config]
#   This section allows to import config from other sources
#   Repeate this section how often as necessary.
# 
#   Fields :
#     import   : gives the path to an other source of configuration
#                can be a local file or a url. Substitutions are applied.
# 
# [require]
#   This section describes things that have to be met before letting user mount/umount filers
#   Repeat this section how often as necessary.
# 
#   Fields concerning the tests :
#     ping : check ping to server
#     smb  : check connection to port 139 of the server
#     http : check connection to port 80 of the server
#     url  : check download of that url (fails if return code != 200)
#   
#   Fields concerning action taken when the test is not positive
#     load_cache : loads config from cache, if any (default False).
#     msg        : message to display
#     abort      : wheter or not exit the application
# 
# [substitution]
#   This section describes a substitution that will be performed at run
#   time by the script.
#   Repeat this section how often as necessary.
#   
#   Fields :
#     label      : what will be substituted
#     value      : the value that will be used               (priority 1)
#     url        : if no value, get the value from this url  (priority 2)
#                  note : in case of multi-value given by the server
#                  (with "\n"), the user's choice is saved localy
#     url_saved  : same as url but always saves the value    (priority 3)
#                  localy for later use
#     ask        : if no value yet for this substitution     (priority 4)
#                  then ask this question to the user
#     constraint : force the value to follow this constraint
#                  can be : lowercase, uppercase
# 
# [mount]
#   This section describes one mount instruction. The fields necessary
#   depends on the method (protocol) choosen. Those methods supported
#   yet are :
#     smb : generic SMB/CIFS (will depend on the Operating System)
#     gvfs_smb   : uses gvfs-mount for CIFS/SMB shares in background (default for Linux)
#     mount.cifs : uses mount.cifs in background
#     mount_smbfs : uses mount_smbfs in background (default for MacOSX)
#   Repeat this section how often as necessary.
#   
#   Fields for all :
#     method : which method to use (smb, gvfs_smb, mount.cifs, mount_smbfs, ...)
#   
#   Fields for mount.cifs :
#     username   : for authtication while mounting
#     domain     : for authtication while mounting
#     auth_realm : not the password, but the realm associated to it.
#                  If several mounts use the same auth_realm, then the
#                  password is only asked once.
#     server_name   : the fileserver
#     server_path   : the path (including share name) to mount
#     local_path    : the path which will contain the mountpoint
#     mount.cifs_filemode : option given to mount.cifs
#     mount.cifs_dirmode  : option given to mount.cifs
#     mount.cifs_options  : option given to mount.cifs
#     
#   Fields for gvfs_smb :
#     username   : for authtication while mounting
#     domain     : for authtication while mounting
#     auth_realm : not the password, but the realm associated to it.
#                  If several mounts use the same auth_realm, then the
#                  password is only asked once.
#     server_name : the fileserver
#     server_path : the path (including share name) to mount
#     gvfs_symlink : Enables the creation of a symbolic link to
#                    "local_path" afer mount (default : True)
#     local_path : the location where the mount will be made available
#                  via a symlink (only when gvfs_symlink is set to True)
